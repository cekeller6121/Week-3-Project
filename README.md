This is my first JavaScript project while at the Iron Yard. I've had to look a lot of commands up and most of them I didn't even know existed (before Monday when we started learning JS). This project was pretty challenging but so much fun and I learned so much. I decided to write longer code so that I get more accustomed to writing and watching the code as it works. I'm excited to see what my next project brings and what I can do better!

*Code revision branch started, revisiting project August 9*
I'm coming back to this project and looking at the JavaScript as well as possibly some styling...we'll see.
